	<h2>Why doesn't my name match my discord name? Why is another me on the server?</h2>
	This can be three reason:<br>
	1. Some technical issue while requesting your google information: Nothing is perfect. Please contact me on Gmail or Discord.<br>
	2. Your account isn't safe: Your account had been use by other people: either Disocrd or Google account. Please secure your account and verify again using /verify command.<br>
	3. A server admin is trolling: It's always fun to troll other people until getting catched by me or bot and get banned.<br>

	<h2>What do you do to my personal information?</h2>
	I only get your unique discord id, gmail address, and user name. The unique discord id is used to identify your account (kind of like a tag for your account). Your email are used to prevent verification from people who aren't in KAS. The username is used to replace your username on discord(only on server) so everyone can identify you.

	<h2>How does this verification work</h2>
	First, the KAS bot will send you a unique link with your unique discord id (if you don't receieve one, type /verify in server). I don't recommand leaking your discord unique id to anyone. Next, when you click on the link, The site stores your discord as a cookie on your device, and redirect after success. And then, the next page lets you look at the info. If you type in the URL, it will redirect you to close.html. Next, it will verify that you are not a bot since I don't want anyone's account to have trouble with retriving their account back. Next, It ask for you to log in using school Google account. Don't think that I will leak your account info to teacher, or even anyone because your information isn't stored anywhere, except the discord unique id as a cookie on your device and your name on server. Last, the system take your information and give it to the KAS bot. The bot assign your name and role automatically.

	<h2>Why does it say close this site and click on the link again</h2>
	I don't want anyone to mess around with my system, so I use http post method to check if you are doing the things step by step. Don't even try to break it since I use http post method, which I feel pretty safe unless you are someone much more professional than me.<br>
